In this homework, we are going to use the ggplot2 package to plot the **Iris** data showing length vs width facetting petal/sepal vs flower type. Basically, there are two steps for this work:  
1. Reshape the **Iris** data for final plotting;  
2. Plot reshaped **Iris** data.  

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#require libraries for this work
require(ggplot2)# advanced graphic library
require(reshape2)# data manipunation library
```

Let's look at the original **Iris** data. It contains 150 observations with 5 variables. And we find that the width and length of these flowers were measured on two different charachteristics: Sepal and Petal. 
```{r}
dim(iris)#look at the dimension of this dataset
head(iris)#only display the first few lines 
```

Based on the new **iris_melted** data, we find that the column `variable` contains the information we are interested, and we want to split them into two parts: Sepal/Petal and Length/Width.

```{r }
# We add a column to keep track of the flower
iris$flower_id <- rownames(iris)
# Default options
iris_melted <- melt(iris)
head(iris_melted)
```

Now, we get the melted data we need. 
```{r }
# split that variable column to get the columns we need
split_variable <- strsplit(as.character(iris_melted$variable),split="\\.")
# Create two new variables type and part
iris_melted$flower_part <- sapply(split_variable, "[", 1)
iris_melted$measurement_type <- sapply(split_variable, "[", 2)
# Remove the one we don't need anymore
iris_melted$variable <- NULL
head(iris_melted)
```

It's much closer to the dataframe which we want. But we still need to do some more work in order to make each obeservation contains both Length and Width. Let's use `dcast` function

```{r reshape2-cast}
iris_cast <- dcast(iris_melted, formula=flower_id+Species+flower_part~measurement_type)
head(iris_cast)
```

Up to now, our dataframe is prepared for making plots!
```{r ggplot-iris, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data=iris_cast, aes(x=Width, y=Length,color=Species,shape=flower_part))+ 
  # Add points and use free scales in the facet
  geom_point()+facet_grid(Species~flower_part, scale="free")+
  # Add a regression line
  geom_smooth(method="lm",size=1)+
  # Use the black/white theme and increase the font size
  theme_bw(base_size=20)
```

The end.  

##Comments
Good job and a nice plot, Ning! I don't have anything else to add. -Wendy
